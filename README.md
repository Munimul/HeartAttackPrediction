The dataset I have used here is from Kaggle, uploaded and maintained by Rashik Rahman. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset
heart-attack-prediction.ipynb can run on local machine but the data set has to be loaded first before executing. For users convenience, heart.csv file has been added to this repository

The .ipynb file includes all the preprocessing, building and training scripts. 
Algorithm used for training and building: KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and SVC from sklearn.
Parameters for these algorithms: Multiple parameters have been used initially to train all the models to select the best set of parameters of each algorithm that applies to this dataset.
